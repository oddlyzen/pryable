h1. *Pryable*

Give your classes some introspection from Pry.

To use, include Pryable:
<pre>
  <code>
  include Pryable
  </code>
</pre>
  
Then, either in the body of a method or in irb, just call #pry_open, like:
<pre>
  <code>
  def do_something
    @setup = something
    pry_open
  end
  </code>
</pre>
  
You will be launched into a Pry session _inside_ the current context. You can use familiar-looking Pry commands then, such as @ls@, @cd Module@, @cd Class@, @cd ..@

*Pryable* is in active development, so expect the API to change and features to be added. If you'd like to help out, see the guidelines below.

h2. Contributing to *Pryable*
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
